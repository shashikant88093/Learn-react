# Senior React Developer Interview Questions and Answers

## **Technical Questions**

### **ReactJS & JavaScript**

#### Q1: Can you explain the difference between `state` and `props` in React and give a real-world scenario of their usage?
- **Answer:**
  - `State` is internal to the component and used to manage mutable data, while `props` are external, immutable, and used to pass data between components.
  - **Example:** For a shopping cart, the total items could be `state` (tracked internally), while product details passed from a parent could be `props`.

#### Q2: How would you optimize a React application for performance? Can you provide an example where you implemented such optimization?
- **Answer:**
  - Techniques include using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders, lazy loading components, and splitting bundles using tools like `React.lazy`.
  - **Example:** I once used `useMemo` in a dashboard app to prevent recalculations of a large dataset for every render.

#### Q3: What is the purpose of React hooks like `useEffect` and `useMemo`? How have you used them in previous projects?
- **Answer:**
  - `useEffect` is used for side effects like API calls.
  - `useMemo` caches calculations for expensive operations.
  - **Example:** I used `useEffect` to fetch data when a dependency changed and `useMemo` to optimize the filtering logic in a product list.

#### Q4: What is React's reconciliation process, and how does it improve the efficiency of the DOM updates?
- **Answer:**
  - React updates the virtual DOM and calculates the differences using the diffing algorithm. Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM. This minimizes performance overhead.

#### Q5: Explain the significance of error boundaries in React. How do you implement one?
- **Answer:**
  - Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in child components during rendering and prevent the entire app from crashing.
  - **Example:** I wrapped the main layout with an error boundary to display fallback UI for unpredictable errors.

### **React Native (Optional)**

#### Q6: Have you worked on React Native projects? If yes, how do you handle platform-specific components or functionality?
- **Answer:**
  - Yes, I worked on a cross-platform app. I used platform-specific file naming conventions (`.ios.js` and `.android.js`) and conditional rendering with `Platform.OS` for custom features.

### **API Integration**

#### Q7: How do you handle asynchronous API requests in React, and what strategies do you follow to manage error handling and retries?
- **Answer:**
  - I use `fetch` or `axios` for API calls, wrap calls in try-catch blocks for error handling, and implement retries for critical operations using libraries like `react-query`.

#### Q8: Discuss your approach to managing data and state in an application with RESTful APIs.
- **Answer:**
  - I prefer global state management tools like Redux or Context API with reducers. I normalize API data and update only relevant slices of the state to avoid over-fetching.

### **Tooling (Git, Webpack, Babel)**

#### Q9: How have you customized a Webpack configuration for a React project? Can you describe a challenging scenario?
- **Answer:**
  - I have configured aliases for better imports, added loaders for SCSS, and optimized builds with plugins like `TerserPlugin`.
  - **Example:** Configuring Webpack to use tree-shaking for reducing bundle size in a complex project.

#### Q10: Describe a situation where version control (Git) helped you resolve a major issue in a collaborative development environment.
- **Answer:**
  - While resolving a bug, I used Git bisect to identify the commit causing the issue. I fixed the code and documented the change for team awareness.

## **Behavioral Questions**

### **Problem-Solving**

#### Q11: Tell me about a time you had to debug a particularly challenging bug in a React application. How did you approach it?
- **Answer:**
  - A component wasn’t updating despite API calls succeeding. I found that React state updates were being overridden due to a race condition. Solved it by wrapping updates in functional state updates.

#### Q12: Can you describe a feature you designed or enhanced that significantly improved user experience or application efficiency?
- **Answer:**
  - I once refactored a form component for a payment gateway by reducing validation delay with debouncing and introducing client-side checks. It improved usability and reduced API load by 20%.

### **Collaboration**

#### Q13: How do you ensure code quality and maintainability in a collaborative team environment? Can you share your experience with code reviews?
- **Answer:**
  - I maintain consistent code style using ESLint/Prettier and document critical functions. During code reviews, I suggest improvements while prioritizing learning over criticism.

#### Q14: Share an example of how you handled disagreements or differences of opinion with team members regarding code implementation.
- **Answer:**
  - I emphasize data-driven decisions. For example, I resolved a conflict over a state-management library by benchmarking performance and finding common ground.

## **Scenario-Based Questions**

#### Q15: You notice that a React component is re-rendering unnecessarily, causing performance degradation. How would you identify and fix the issue?
- **Answer:**
  - Used React DevTools to trace unnecessary renders, identified a missing dependency in a `useEffect` hook, and wrapped frequent components with `React.memo`.

#### Q16: A financial application requires high security for user data. How would you ensure that sensitive information is protected within a React-based front end?
- **Answer:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data on the client side using libraries like CryptoJS. I also implement strict CORS policies and HTTP-only cookies for session tokens.

#### Q17: Agile practices often lead to changing requirements. How do you handle mid-sprint changes while keeping up with deadlines?
- **Answer:**
  - Maintain an adaptable architecture and communicate with stakeholders to prioritize features. Use story point allocation to manage expectations.

## **Soft Skills Assessment**

#### Q18: Describe a time when you communicated a complex technical concept to a non-technical team member. How did you ensure clarity?
- **Answer:**
  - In explaining React state to a designer, I used an analogy of a “shared whiteboard” where some notes are internal, and others (props) are written by someone else.

#### Q19: How do you prioritize tasks when multiple stakeholders request high-priority features or fixes simultaneously?
- **Answer:**
  - Use a RICE scoring framework (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to determine task priority. Communicate delays or challenges to stakeholders proactively.

#### Q20: In a fast-paced environment, how do you balance the need for rapid development with maintaining code quality?
- **Answer:**
  - Use automated tests and modular architecture to minimize bugs during rapid development cycles while consistently conducting peer reviews.
