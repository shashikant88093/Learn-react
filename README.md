# Interview Questions for 5 Years Experience Developer

## Technical Skills

### React & TypeScript
- **How do you manage state in a large React application?**  
  In large React applications, state management can be handled using tools like Redux, Zustand, or React's Context API combined with hooks. For complex states, Redux with middleware like Redux-Saga or Redux-Thunk helps manage asynchronous actions effectively. Keeping local UI state within components and lifting shared state to the nearest common ancestor improves performance.  
  **Example:** In an e-commerce app, Redux is used to manage cart items globally, while local UI state like modal visibility is managed within individual components.

- **What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**  
  Controlled components have their state managed by React through props, making them predictable and easier to debug. Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally using refs, which is simpler for quick forms but harder to maintain in large applications.  
  **Example:** A controlled form input uses `value` and `onChange` props, while an uncontrolled form uses `ref` to access the DOM element directly.

- **Can you explain the purpose of TypeScript’s `interface` and `type`? When would you use one over the other?**  
  `interface` is used to define the shape of an object and is extendable through declaration merging. `type` can define more complex types like unions and intersections. Use `interface` for defining object structures and `type` when working with complex type compositions.  
  **Example:** Use `interface` to define a user object structure and `type` to create union types like `type Status = 'active' | 'inactive';`.

- **Describe how you optimize React performance in complex applications.**  
  Performance optimizations include memoizing components with `React.memo`, using `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, code-splitting with `React.lazy`, lazy loading images, and optimizing dependencies in effect hooks.  
  **Example:** In a dashboard, `React.memo` is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of data tables when unrelated state changes.

### Backend Integration
- **How do you manage API requests and handle errors gracefully in React applications?**  
  API requests are managed using libraries like Axios or Fetch. Centralizing API calls with a service layer helps maintainability. Error handling involves try-catch blocks, displaying user-friendly messages, and implementing global error boundaries.  
  **Example:** An Axios instance is created with interceptors for handling token expiration and global error notifications.

- **Describe a situation where you integrated multiple microservices into a front-end project. What challenges did you face?**  
  Integrating multiple microservices often involves handling inconsistent data formats, varying response times, and authentication challenges. Using GraphQL or API Gateway helps aggregate services, while caching mechanisms and retry logic improve resilience.  
  **Example:** In a logistics app, data from shipment, tracking, and billing services were aggregated using GraphQL, with caching to reduce redundant API calls.

### AWS & Cloud Technologies
- **Have you worked with AWS Lambda and API Gateway? Can you explain how they interact within a serverless architecture?**  
  AWS Lambda runs serverless functions, while API Gateway acts as the interface to trigger these functions via HTTP requests. API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate Lambda functions, enabling scalable and cost-effective APIs.  
  **Example:** A file upload service uses API Gateway to receive requests and triggers a Lambda function to process and store files in S3.

- **How would you set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and GitHub Actions?**  
  The pipeline starts with GitHub Actions triggering on code push events. CodeBuild handles build and test processes, followed by deployment steps to services like AWS S3 or ECS. Artifacts are versioned and security checks are integrated into the workflow.  
  **Example:** A React app's CI/CD pipeline runs tests on GitHub Actions, builds the project in CodeBuild, and deploys it to an S3 bucket configured with CloudFront.

### Database & Microservices
- **What’s the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases? When would you prefer DynamoDB over MongoDB?**  
  SQL databases are relational and structured with predefined schemas, suitable for complex queries. NoSQL databases like DynamoDB (key-value store) and MongoDB (document store) handle unstructured data. DynamoDB is preferred for serverless applications due to its scalability and tight AWS integration.  
  **Example:** DynamoDB is used in a serverless app for storing user sessions due to its fast read/write capabilities and auto-scaling features.

- **How do you ensure data consistency across microservices in a distributed system?**  
  Data consistency is managed using event-driven architectures with tools like Kafka, implementing eventual consistency, and using distributed transactions or the Saga pattern for complex workflows.  
  **Example:** In an order processing system, the Saga pattern ensures that inventory updates, payment processing, and shipping are coordinated across microservices.

### Testing & DevOps
- **What’s your approach to Test-Driven Development (TDD) in React projects?**  
  TDD involves writing unit tests before implementing the code. Using Jest with React Testing Library ensures component behavior is tested. Mocking external dependencies and writing integration tests for key workflows improve test coverage.  
  **Example:** Writing tests for a login form to validate input fields and simulate API responses before implementing the form logic.

- **How do you ensure secure coding practices, especially in CI/CD pipelines?**  
  Secure practices include code reviews, static code analysis, dependency vulnerability checks, secrets management, and automated security tests within CI/CD pipelines using tools like SonarQube or AWS CodePipeline security integrations.  
  **Example:** Integrating SonarQube with the CI pipeline to automatically scan for code vulnerabilities and enforce security policies.

## Project Management & Leadership

### Mentorship & Code Review
- **How do you handle code reviews? What key aspects do you focus on while reviewing a PR?**  
  Focus areas include code readability, adherence to coding standards, performance, security vulnerabilities, and test coverage. Providing constructive feedback and suggesting improvements fosters a positive review culture.  
  **Example:** Reviewing a PR for a new feature, focusing on logic correctness, performance optimization, and ensuring comprehensive unit tests are included.

- **Share an experience where you mentored a junior developer. What strategies helped you improve their performance?**  
  Mentoring involves regular check-ins, pairing sessions, code reviews with detailed explanations, and setting achievable goals. Encouraging independent problem-solving and providing resources for continuous learning enhances growth.  
  **Example:** Pair programming with a junior developer to improve their understanding of React hooks, followed by assigning small tasks to build confidence.

### Agile Practices
- **How do you manage sprint tasks and ensure timely delivery of features?**  
  Tasks are broken down into manageable user stories, prioritized in sprint planning sessions. Daily stand-ups track progress, and regular retrospectives help identify process improvements. Continuous integration ensures faster feedback loops.  
  **Example:** In a project, tasks were divided into user stories with clear acceptance criteria, tracked using Jira for progress monitoring.

- **What’s your experience with tools like Jira in managing agile projects?**  
  Jira is used for backlog management, sprint planning, tracking issues, and generating reports on team performance. Custom workflows and automation rules enhance productivity and transparency.  
  **Example:** Configuring Jira dashboards to visualize sprint progress, track blockers, and monitor team velocity.

## Problem-Solving & System Design

### Architecture & Design Patterns
- **How would you design a scalable front-end architecture for an e-commerce application?**  
  Use a modular architecture with reusable components, state management (Redux), lazy loading, and micro-frontend patterns. Implement responsive design, SEO optimization, and scalable API integration.  
  **Example:** In an e-commerce site, components for product listing, cart, and checkout are modular, with lazy loading for product images to improve performance.

- **Can you explain the microservices architecture and its benefits over a monolithic approach?**  
  Microservices break down applications into independent services, each handling specific functionality. Benefits include scalability, faster development cycles, easier maintenance, and technology flexibility.  
  **Example:** A payment service operates independently from the user management service, allowing each to scale and deploy separately.

### Real-World Scenarios
- **Imagine your React app has performance issues during peak traffic. How would you diagnose and resolve this?**  
  Use performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks. Optimize code with memoization, code-splitting, efficient state management, and CDN caching for static assets.  
  **Example:** Identifying slow API responses causing re-renders, optimizing the API, and using `useMemo` to cache data.

- **You’re tasked with migrating an existing monolithic application to microservices. What would your approach be?**  
  Start with identifying independent modules. Gradually extract services while ensuring data consistency. Implement API gateways, monitor service health, and adopt CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment.  
  **Example:** Migrating a monolithic order processing system to separate services for orders, inventory, and payments, with communication via REST APIs and message queues.
